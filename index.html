  <h1> WELCOME TO MY STATIC WEBSITE </h1>
  <p>Have you ever been <em>mesmerized</em> before? If you’ve never witnessed greatness then you’re in for a treat. This is arguably the greatest HTML website known to mankind. The code is written with precision and eloquence and maintains a visual aesthetic similar to Michelangelo’s paintbrush.</p>
